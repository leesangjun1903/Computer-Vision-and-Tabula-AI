## Structure from Motion
Structure from Motion (SfM) is the name given to the procedure of reconstructing a 3D scene and simultaneously obtaining the camera poses of a camera w.r.t. the given scene. This means that, as the name suggests, we are creating the entire rigid structure from a set of images with different view points (or equivalently a camera in motion).
In this competition, the important aspect of SfM we are interested in is obtaining the camera poses of where each image was taken, described by a rotation matrix and translation vector from the origin.
